  --pretrain_init {random,agent}
                        pretraining randomly or with agent
  --for_all             Only to be used if testing. this flag will evaluate
                        all saved models
  --plot                Only to be used if testing. this flag will plot
                        rewards and losses during training

                        folder_id
  --total_episodes TOTAL_EPISODES
                        testing will done for given number of episodes
  --restore_model       only to be used to restore model for training purpose
  --restore_memory      only to be used if saved memory during training, want
                        to restore that memory
